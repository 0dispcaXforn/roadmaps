## Step 2: Import Your Photo
 
Once you have installed FaceFilter3 Pro, you can launch it and import your photo. You can either drag and drop your photo into the software or click on the "Open Image" button on the top left corner of the interface. You can also import photos from your webcam or scanner by clicking on the "Capture" button.
 
After importing your photo, you can adjust the orientation, crop, and rotate it as needed. You can also zoom in and out by using the mouse wheel or the slider on the bottom right corner of the interface.
 
## Step 3: Apply Facial Fitting
 
The next step is to apply facial fitting to your photo. Facial fitting is a process that detects and aligns the facial features of your photo with the software's facial model. This allows you to apply accurate and realistic effects to your photo later.
 
To apply facial fitting, click on the "Facial Fitting" button on the top right corner of the interface. You will see a green mask overlaying your photo with dots and lines indicating the facial features. You can adjust the mask by dragging the dots or using the sliders on the right panel. You can also choose from different facial models by clicking on the "Model" button.
 
When you are satisfied with the facial fitting, click on the "OK" button to confirm it.
 
## Step 4: Enhance Your Photo
 
Now comes the fun part: enhancing your photo with various effects and tools. FaceFilter3 Pro offers four main modes for photo enhancement: Skin, Makeup, Reshape, and Effect. You can switch between these modes by clicking on the tabs on the top of the interface.
 
In each mode, you can choose from different templates and presets for one-click application, or customize your own settings by using the sliders and brushes on the right panel. You can also compare your original photo with your edited photo by clicking on the "Compare" button on the bottom left corner of the interface.
 
Here are some examples of what you can do with each mode:
 
- Skin: You can smooth your skin, remove wrinkles, blemishes, redness, and shine, whiten your teeth, brighten your eyes, and more.
- Makeup: You can apply different makeup styles such as natural, glamorous, artistic, etc., or create your own makeup by choosing from various colors and textures for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, etc. You can also adjust the intensity and opacity of each makeup layer.
- Reshape: You can reshape your facial features such as nose, eyes, mouth, chin, etc., by using different morphing tools such as move, rotate, scale, etc. You can also enhance your expressions by adjusting your eyebrows, eyel 8cf37b1e13
